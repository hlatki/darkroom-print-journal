# darkroom-print-journal
When you're doing analog photography, it's helpful to have a record of how you made a particluar print so that you can recreate it later. The LaTeX file in this repo will generate a book containing a title page and some number of sheets for recording the details of your prints. The resulting PDF can then be printed, bound and used in the darkroom.
