# A Journal for Analog Printing
When you're doing analog photography, it's helpful to have a record of how you made a particluar print so that you can recreate it later. The LaTeX file in this repo will generate a book containing a title page and some number of sheets for recording the details of your prints. The resulting PDF can then be printed, bound and used in the darkroom.


## OK, I want one
If you'd like a print journal of your own, download the latest [version](https://github.com/hlatki/darkroom-print-journal/releases/latest/download/journal.pdf) and print it out! You can also have your local print shop print and bind it if you'd like something a bit sturdier. Happy printing!
